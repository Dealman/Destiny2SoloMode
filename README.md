# Destiny 2 PC - SoloMode

# What
Disables matchmaking in Destiny 2 *(PC)*, making it possible to visit the Tower and play Strikes alone. Useful for interacting with the immensely buggy EDZ Obelisk as well as playing Strikes at your own pacing instead of trying to keep up with speedrunners.

# How
By adding custom inbound and outbound rules to the Windows Firewall, blocking the traffic sent and received by the Destiny 2 matchmaker. Thus since a match can't be found, it'll put you in an empty instance alone.

Should be straight-forward to use, click the big colourful buttons.

Not sure if it works on Windows 7, haven't tested. Might be able to add support for it since it uses Microsoft's Firewall API.

# Why
Initially made to help interact with the buggy EDZ Obelisk, but can also assist in playing Strikes alone or visiting an empty Tower *(much lower loading time for visiting the Tower)*.

I'm a strong believer that Destiny 2 should support private Strikes, given how incredibly anti-teamwork a lot of the bounties are. And not to mention all the sweaty tryhard speedrunners just wanting to finish the Strike ASAP.

This is not intended to be used in any malicious way, if it can even be used in such a way - I strongly discourage it. Don't cheat, enjoy the game.

# Disclaimer
This might be against the Destiny 2 Terms of Service and as such is to be used at your own risk. I will not be held responsible if your account is suspended because of this program - even though I highly doubt it as all you're doing is using Window's own fucking firewall. Surely Bungie can't be that stupid, right? Right? :(
